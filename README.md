# Position: Solve Layerwise Linear Models First to Understand Neural Dynamical Phenomena (Neural Collapse, Emergence, Lazy/Rich Regime, and Grokking)

## Figure 6
```fig6(a,b)_run.py``` run experiments for Figure. 6 and saves the result in ./data

```fig6(a,b)_plot.py``` plots the experiment results in ./data to ./plot/6(a,b).pdf

## Figure 11
```fig11_run.py --subfig (a-f)``` runs the grokking experiments for a subfigure of Figure. 11 (defualt: a) and saves the result in ./data

```fig11_plot.py --subfig (a-f)``` pltos a subfigure of Figure. 11 (defualt: a) and save it as ./plot/11(a-f).pdf
